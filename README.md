# grouping_students
A short script to divide students into groups, while maintaining the variance of the group scores low.
This was just a little fun. So I could explain to my Java MSc students how I grouped them in what I considered to be the most fair method.

* [students.csv](https://github.com/samicd/grouping_students/blob/master/students.csv) - Contains anonamised student data
* [student_opt-2.py](https://github.com/samicd/grouping_students/blob/master/student_opt-2.py) - Contains 5 functions. 
        *To import data.
        *Create and shuffle groups of students.
        *Evaluate all groups.
        *Display groups.
        *Repeat shuffeling until the variance is within a certain value.
